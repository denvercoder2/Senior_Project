# StarMap ReadMe 

## Main Branches and Main Participants
- Python
  - Robert was the main worker on this branch. It was determined to be the spot for most of the formulae calculations which are later used in our Jython implmentation for finding positions of celestrial objects.

- Java Algorithms
  - John was the main worker on this branch. It's purpose was to initialy take the python formulas and re-write them in Java after we had verified them. It turned into a branch where we all combined our work to be pushed to a GUI using John's framework of creating Space Objects

- Java Parsing
  - Scott was the main worker on this branch. It's purpose was to work in conjunction with the Java Algorithms branch. The data we were given was parsed and transformed, while acounting for object creation to be passed to the GUI. This branch has a combination of Formulae implementation, data parsing, and working with the project as a whole.

- GUI
  - Alexx was the main worker on this branch. It's purpose was to control and use all the data created by the other branches in order to produce a working end product of the StarMap. It handles error checking and user validation as well as data input

- Master
  - Towards the end of the semester, everyone had migrated to this branch. All changes were made to incorporate into this space in order to work together as a single point of execution.
